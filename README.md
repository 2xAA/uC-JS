# µC-JS

Just a placeholder file _and repository_ until µCollective.org's API is ready to roll.

Buuut, I should probably write up the documentation as I go, so here it is:

## Usage

To use µC-JS add this to your document:
```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="uC.js"></script>
```

Now you're pretty much ready to go.

I'll only go over one set of requests here, you can find the rest at µCollective's API documentation (I'll add a link when it's finished).
